# Women-empowerment-
A Women Empowerment Project aims to uplift and empower women by promoting gender equality, enhancing their skills, and improving their social, economic, and political status. These projects seek to break down barriers that limit women's opportunities and provide them with the resources, knowledge, and support needed to achieve their full potential.
